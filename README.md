This repository contains my individual version of the capstone project that I developed during my coding bootcamp. While working on the project, my partners and I had different design choices, which led me to develop my own version with alternative approaches. While I respect my partners' design choices, I would like to present my perspective and showcase the decisions that I made in this repository. 

Features: display items, feed money to the vending machine in whole dollar amounts, select product by entering slot code and I added a special feature where it logs every transaction and creates a seperate log file that contains all the transactions for each different day and added a feature that generates a sales report that outputs the quantity sold for each item and calculates the total sales since the vending machine was turned on and writes it to a seperate log file.
